  <h3>About this Project</h3>

       The hardest part about getting to know using the screen magnifier was how fast the mouse reaching the edge of the screen makes the screen move. At first, I was unsure about how to move the screen around at all, so I zoomed in and out. Of course, this isn't how a person with low vision would do it. I'm able to see the things from far away when they're small - I know what to zoom into! I resolved this problem by moving the mouse to the edges of the screen to pan around. I felt like the mouse was way too sensitive with this. I would move a little bit and fly across the screen. After a bit more experimenting (and accidentally clicking the wrong keys) I discovered that Chrome's zoom works drastically better for web browsing. It resized things automatically! Of course, it would be hard for Mac's native screen zoom to do this - but I'm sure it will some day.

     For this project, I made the low vision mode a darker theme with light text. In addition, I made the text larger, and ensured that the text and buttons were still functional and in place. I had to do a lot of general housekeeping to make sure all of the buttons were visually fluid. Overall, this project taught me how easy it is to make UI accessible to users with low vision. It astounds me that there aren't more applications that open themselves up to more users by making this mode easily accessible, as we did in this project.</p></body>
